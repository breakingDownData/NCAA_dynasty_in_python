Additions: 
- 2/6/2025:
    - can now produce yards gained from run/pass play
        - outcomes generated from NFL 2023 season data
        - two probabilities to use:
            - mean & std.dev 
            - yards gained as pct of total plays to be used as probability for outcome
                - would be cool to see how games play out using one or other outcome
        - expansions: 
            - use more years worth of data
            - identify if teams who have a higher run/pass split have generally higher yardage outcomes when running/passing 
            - categorize defenses by their run/pass stopping ability to impact average yards gain

    - determine whether or not the play chosen will be run/pass depending on the team's run/pass split
    - plotted the distribution of run/passes from NFL data 
        - much wider outcomes for passes, higher average yardage than run
        - narrower outcomes for runs, lower average yardage than pass

    - GOALS for next addition(s): 
        - tracker for down + distance
            - variables:
                - drive_no
                - play_no
                - yardage_marker (where you are on field, your endzone is 0, opponent's endzone is 100)
                - down 
                - distance
                - if down = 4 and distance > 2 -> punt 
                    - 2 can be changed depending on how aggressive users want to be
