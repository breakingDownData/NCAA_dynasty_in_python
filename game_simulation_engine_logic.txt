#### DYNASTY GAME SIMULATION ENGINE

### Structure
## Think of an NFL game like a DAG, each pipeline ran = 1 game played
## while time_remaining > 0 and score_home <> home_away: 
## iterate through calling functions to break down a football game play by play 

### functions to add
## those listed below as well as the following: 
# calculate time play takes up 
# can build out logic for teams to get riskier to try and score points before half 
    - can also make this a user option, aggressive / conservative at end of half situations


### Average run play is 3.3 yards
## look at NFL data for distribution of run distances
### Deeper analysis: Rank runs by calibur of RB + OL and adjust averages to account for high level OL / RB or low level DL 
- rank players by core attributes for their position, higher averages for better RBs 
### simpler analysis: difference in overalls between the following positions scales the average yards per play, higher average or higher standard deviation?
---- shift normal distribution left/right to favor higher ranked grouping. better D -> normal distribution shifts to left, indicating a decrease in average yards per play
- OL & DL
- OL/RB & LB
- QB/WR & DB 

## same goes for passing


#### picking run / pass distribution:
## different offense consitutes difference in run/pass breakdown
## offense: run / pass split 
## air raid: 20 / 80 
## pro style: 50 / 50 
## flexbone: 90 / 10

## model other team's play style like run / pass breakdowns of previous eras (one step further)
- assumes that data is available 
- otherwise teams have a normal distribution of run pass breakdowns for other teams (user entered std deviation (does this make sense to say?)) 



1) 50 / 50 coin flip 
- kickoff, set offense / defense 
- calc if kickoff gets a return 
-- return depends on how a kicker's low kick power is 
- calc return yards
-- distribution of returns 
- calc percent fumble on return 
-- distribution of fumbles on returns as probability 

1 calculate down + distance
- play number 
- something to track yards (to be thought through)
- if set_yds > 10 -> reset down 
- etc 

2 run / pass coin flip 
- run avg yards / play 
- pass avg yards / play 




Defense similar principal
# blitz / coverage
- high blitz rate -> larger std deviation on play gain / loss 
- user entered preferred blitz style 
    - left/right/both side(s)
    - lb/secondary/both 
        - and their rate of blitz

# man / zone 
- not ready to think through this yet 





## Curiosities 
- 3rd and short/medium/long
    - what is the proportion of run/pass?
        - avg yards pp in these instances
    - does +-1/2/3+ score differential play a factor in play choice?
