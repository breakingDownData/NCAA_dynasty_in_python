# to add:

# Players
 - Archetypes
 - skill caps
 - development(????)


# Generate Rosters
- bring in list of teams from CFB, or make random teams
- generate rosters (randomly?)
- create player names via lists of
  - first names
  - last names


# Recruits
 - player states
 - names
 - positions
 - dev traits
 - stars (5,4,3,2,1)
 - scouting
    - to start, generic scout/no scout
    - allow 5 scouts / week
 - how to recruit
    - allocate hours
    - team has designated # of hours
    - find way to allocate hours
    - teams get 100 hours (to start) 
    - allocate up to 20 per player


# Season Progression
- randomly assign scheduling amongst all teams
- create random conferences, set schedules for all teams
- randomly choose who plays whom in the non-conference games


# Team ranking
- rank teams by their average scores for O / D players against all other teams

# Player development

 

# Gameplay projections
### (BIG UNDERTAKING, WOULD BE COOL)



# ( TO SHIP & GET OUT THE DOOR )
- GET out the door purely based on high overall 
- more skills -> more impact on variability of game outcomes



# find similar star rated college player stats
- push stats into ML model to create player projections
    - training data has star rating mapped out, i.e. ryan williams' stats are painstakingly mapped, versus everyone elses'
    - testing data would have various stat lines

# could even use NFL data (even though overall stats are lower)
- (  big 12 scoring  )  vs (  Watson-led Browns v  Panthers 2024  )
- or even NFL teams, scale ppg / ypg by skill amounts
- also defensive tackles, PBUs, completion rate, etc
- low PPG (O) and low YPG allowed (D) -> low scoring game
- build model off of college statistics

# assume players at better schools are better players~~~hold this thought
